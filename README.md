# KaiserBot
KaiserBot is a custom made time-telling bot made for @Zadrave#0850.

Unfortunately with discord.py dying, I am not going to continue this branch of KaiserBot and move over to my own C++ framework; a language I am far more comfortable with. After this release, the repository will be archived. You can find the new Kaiserbot C++ repository at https://github.com/LunarEcklipse/kaiserbot-cpp once I get it underway. Thanks for your time, and I hope you have a nice day.
